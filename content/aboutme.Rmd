**Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution**
  
Since 2011, I work in ecology and especially I study influence of urbanised world on ecosystems. I am interesting by statistics and R-used.  
  
This site is a place to share my statisitics and R-used. In the near futur, I will propose help for analysing your data.
